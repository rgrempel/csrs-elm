# CSRS Membership Web Site

This is the code for a membership database that I am working on for the
Canadian Society for Renaissance Studies.

This branch is the original Angular (via JHipster) version of the app.
I've been working on porting the app to Elm, but needed to get this
branch working so I could make some modifications to the existing code.
