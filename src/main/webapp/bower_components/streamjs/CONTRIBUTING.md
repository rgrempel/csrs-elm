## How to contribute to Stream.js

* Please [search](https://github.com/winterbe/streamjs/issues) for previous discussions about the same feature or issue before opening new tickets.

* Before sending a pull request for a feature, make sure a corresponding [issue](https://github.com/winterbe/streamjs/issues) exists, so discussions can take place beforehand.

* All code changes must be covered by [qunit tests](https://github.com/winterbe/streamjs/tree/master/test). Run `grunt test` before sending a pull request.

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the [codebase](https://github.com/winterbe/streamjs/blob/master/streamjs.js).

* New features must be well documented in the [APIDOC](https://github.com/winterbe/streamjs/blob/master/APIDOC.md). Do not put the minified `stream-min.js` in your pull request.
