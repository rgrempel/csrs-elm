email.existingMember.dear=Dear 
email.existingMember.text1=The Canadian Society for Renaissance Studies has developed a membership database, which we have been using to keep track of contact information, subscriptions, and of course, membership itself. Until now, the database has been accessible only to the Executive, but we have now developed a member interface that will allow you to update and confirm your information, including address and scholarly interests.
email.existingMember.text2=By clicking on the following link, you will be taken to the database, for a two-step process. First, create a username and password for the site. Next, you will see your information, which you can then edit and/or confirm.
email.existingMember.text3=We appreciate your participation in this. Later this fall, we hope to do our membership renewals through the database, and if you have already signed in and updated your information, the process then will be all the easier.
email.existingMember.text4=Best regards,
email.existingMember.treasurer=Treasurer
